### Using BFS, IDDFS, and A* Search to Solve 15-Puzzle

The 15-Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The objective is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

#### Objective:

Develop algorithms to solve the 15-Puzzle using the following search strategies:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**
- **A* Search**
- **Iterative Deepening A* Search**
